What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	git creates a folder for containing the history information of the
	repository. I need to do this otherwhise git doesn't have the metadata
	that it needs for work with the repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Permit to perform logical changes all at once and other things.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By checking the differences between working directory and staging area,
	and also between staging area and repository.
