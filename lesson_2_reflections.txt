What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	git creates a folder for containing the history information of the
	repository. I need to do this otherwhise git doesn't have the metadata
	that it needs for work with the repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Permit to perform logical changes all at once and other things.
