How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It helped focusing only on thing that has changed and not on the whole
	document.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can save a lot of work by compare file that have changed and get a close
	look on the differences.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: more control on when to save for logical steps,
	Con: more subsceptible of human error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different pourpose of working.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log for viewing the repository commits and git diff to view the
	differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can return to previous version of the project and easily find the
	bugs by comparing the versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To keep track of important files in my project! Yeah!
