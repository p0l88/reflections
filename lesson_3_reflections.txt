When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

	When I need to work from different computers or I'm working in remote with
	other people and be sure to have always the latest version of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if I'm working locally on a feature and someone update the github
	version it would eventually overwrite my work.
