When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

	When I need to work from different computers or I'm working in remote with
	other people and be sure to have always the latest version of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if I'm working locally on a feature and someone update the github
	version it would eventually overwrite my work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

	Fork is for work on a different version without modify the original one.
	Clones is for work on a repository that could modify the local version as
	the remote version.
	Branches are useful to work on features or bug correction on a version
	without change the official version at least util the changes are approved.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	
	Benefits are that you have the last changes of the repository on your
	machine and can work locally.
